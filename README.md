# LevelEditorWebApp

Welcome to my Level Editor Web app (also known as VÃ¥rt-Demonium), a platform for sharing and discussing user-created level packs for my [FPS game](https://github.com/mmmdule/RetroFPS). Levels for the game can be created using my [Level Editor desktop app](https://github.com/mmmdule/RetroFPS-LevelEditor)  This forum is built using ASP.NET MVC and provides a seamless experience for level editors and enthusiasts to collaborate.

## Features
- **Create and Share**: Use our desktop editor app to craft unique levels, save them as level packs, and easily share them on the forum.
- **Discover**: Explore user-generated level packs and experience content created by other users.
- **Community Interaction**: Engage with fellow players and creators, provide feedback, Comment and Upvote or Downvote posts. Edit your comments and posts if you wish to change them, or Delete them if you wish to.
